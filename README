puppet-firehol
==============

puppet module to manage firehol

WARNING: this module will completely wipe out any previous firehol
configuration as well as any files in /etc/firehol not that are not managed by
puppet

generates a tree of configuration files in /etc/firehol for interfaces and
services.

usage
=====

firehol::interface { "eth0":
	policy => "accept",
	interface_alias => "lan",
	sources => ["192.168.0.0/16"],
}

firehol::interface { "eth1":
	policy => "drop",
	interface_alias => "internet",
	not_sources => ["192.168.0.0/16"],
}

firehol::server { "lan-ssh":
	service_name => "ssh",
	interface_name => "eth0",
	policy => "accept",
}

todo
====

- need to sort out a better solution for allowing all outbound client connections
  on an interface
- more testing on various distributions
- the "status" action for the service isn't reliable - puppet will refresh the
  service on each run

caveats
=======

- firehol isn't widely available in distribution package repositories - for
  RHEL, at least.
